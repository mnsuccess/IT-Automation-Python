Please check off the following topics to confirm that you already understand them! You're only expected to understand the basics of how to manipulate themâ€”details about usage will be explained later if needed. If anything looks unfamiliar, you can check out one of the[introductory Python classes](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036). This course will also default to [Python 2](https://docs.python.org/2/) where applicable, though it's very similar to [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/)!

### Comments

    # This is a one-line Python comment - code blocks are so useful!
    """This type of comment is used to document the purpose of functions and classes."""

### Declaration/Initialization

    # Remember values, not variables, have data types.
    # A variable can be reassigned to contain a different data type.
    answer = 42
    answer = "The answer is 42."

### Data Types

    boolean = True
    number = 1.1
    string = "Strings can be declared with single or double quotes."
    list = ["Lists can have", 1, 2, 3, 4, "or more types together!"]
    tuple = ("Tuples", "can have", "more than", 2, "elements!")
    dictionary = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
    variable_with_zero_data = None

### Simple Logging

    print "Printed!"

### Conditionals

    if cake == "delicious":
        return "Yes please!"
    elif cake == "okay":
        return "I'll have a small piece."
    else:
        return "No, thank you."

### Loops

    for item in list:
        print item

    while (total < max_val):
        total += values[i]
        i += 2

### Functions

    def divide(dividend, divisor):
        quotient = dividend / divisor
        remainder = dividend % divisor
        return quotient, remainder

    def calculate_stuff(x, y):
        (q, r) = divide(x,y)
        print q, r

### Classes

    class Person(object):
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age 

      def birthday(self):
          self.age += 1
